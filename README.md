### DDOS-Prediction
A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) prediction project using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) involves developing a deep learning model to detect and predict DDoS attacks based on network traffic data. The ANN is trained on features extracted from historical network traffic, such as packet rate, source IP diversity, and traffic patterns etc. By learning to recognize the characteristics of normal and malicious traffic, the model can predict potential DDoS attacks.
